# char_generator

Text-generation using GRU layers.

As per the project name, the text generation is done on
a character-by-character basis since I wanted to get things like punctuation
included originally.

Having implemented the most basic RNN design manually, this project I focussed
on more advanced types of RNNs, like LSTMs and GRUs. This particular project
resulted in me settling on a GRU due to the faster training and similar enough
performance to LSTMs.
