# rnn

As per the name, this project was my initial attempt to learn about RNNs, first
by creating one without using keras or any other purpose-built machine learning
library, and then another version using keras.

Throughout this project I learned about what RNNs specifically were, having
only worked with DNNs in the past, while also practicing keras for the first
time.
