A basic breast cancer classifier trained on the Wisconsin data set.

I experimented with keras a lot with this project, working with various types
of layers, activation functions, and optimization algorithms. I ultimately
settled on using a basic DNN with RELU for the activation function, although
I had tried some more out-of-the-box ideas such as a 1D CNN.
