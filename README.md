# ml-projects

This is a collection of some projects in machine learning that I've worked on
in the past. Most are pretty small and not very polished, but are part of my
progress in learning more about neural networks during the winter of 2020-2021.

Each individual project has its own README that goes into more depth about the
specific project. Chronologically, I first worked on `rnn`, then created
`breast_cancer` using the Wisconsin data set, and finally worked on
`char_generator` using a corpus consisting of essays I wrote as well as PF
debate cases from 2018-2020.

None of the data sets themselves are included in this repository to avoid
issues with copyright and potentially privacy.
